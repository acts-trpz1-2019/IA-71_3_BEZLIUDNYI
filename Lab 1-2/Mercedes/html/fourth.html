                    <p class="big-text">THE 2018 E-CLASS</p>
                    <p class="text-block" id="second-block">The highway gently curves as you begin to climb the last grade before the city limits. Your hand only lightly grips the wheel. Your foot is merely resting on the gas pedal. You feel your car brake as a motorhome - two lanes too far to the left - it loses its momentum in your path. You check the mirror, tap the turn signal lever, and without changing your grip or moving your feet, your E-Class executes a move with a charge of a fullback and the grace of a ballerina. Another tap and you're back in the third lane, back at your cruising speed, and suddenly, in your mind, back at the kids' dinner table.<br><br>Maybe you did not get to orbit the earth, or drive on the moon. That said, the lunar rover didn't have radar-based cruise control, or satellite navigation. No voice control, no climate control, and surely no massaging seats. You think about what your E-Class can do: What you're holding in your hands is used to be the future. But some engineers with wild imaginations turned it into something else: the present. "I'm sure," you say
                        to yourself, "some of them wanted to be an astronaut." And here you are, driving their "Spaceship" to your house. Next year at the family reunion, you're taking that kid for a drive. No, not to the moon. But to the edge of the future she'll someday reinvent.</p>
                    <p class="text-block" id="first-block">Nobody said "astronaut." There were six kids at the family gathering, counting the cousins, and you asked each of them the conversation-starter that's worked for generations. Two of them said they want
                        to be teachers when they grow up. One looked up from her tablet and just said "computers." Another did his best to pronounce "veterinarian." The youngest one just shrugged. And the one who came the closest? She wants to design cars that can drive themselves. Had she just added "to the moon," you'd have called it a win.<br><br> Driving the future.<br> Three hours in your drive home, you're still thinking about it. Of course, you're not in a flying car, nor are you heading to your space colony. But still, you think to yourself, have our dreams been grounded? You turn up the music and keep driving.</p>
                    <p id="red-text-block">The E-Class brings you innovations you will not find in any other brand of car, in any class. And it's the only nameplate in the U.S. which gives you a choice of sedans, wagons, and convertibles.</p>
