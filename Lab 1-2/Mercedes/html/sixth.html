                    <p class="text-block" id="first-block">As the first hint of morning sunlight pokes through your bedroom window, something feels different. Your house is suddenly full auto-pilot: The coffee is freshly ground and brewing on its own. Your shower is prewarmed. Your clothes are hang ready for your day, not just pressed but nicely matched without any effort on your part. In a few minutes, you will be calling your new E-Class by voice, and it will greet you at the door and drive you to work, then return home to bring the kids to school. It all seems like a futuristic dream. And as your alarm wakes you up for real, you realize it is. Or is it?<br><br>
                        Advancing the love of driving. Reality, circa 2018, is not too far from your dream. Your real-life E-Class may not without self-driving, but semi-autonomous the capabilities it does offer were unheard-of just a few years ago. That said, if it could actually offer you to auto-pilot you to work this morning, you would probably say "no thanks." You'd rather be in charge of its turbocharged surge, paddle-shifting through all nine speeds as your hands grip the wheel and the tires grip the road. The symphony of it all is what drives you - the emotion of motion, seamlessly united, with you in the center of it all. Behind the scenes, Direct</p>
                    <p class="text-block" id="second-block">Injection and multispark ignition confer permanently, and instantly - adapting in real time to reduce fuel consumption to more power with fewer emissions. The chassis adapts to the road, with selective damping that firms up in corners, or through AIR BODY CONTROL*, which literally turns the pressure into curves and over bumps.<br><br>
                        When cars can fully drive themselves, performance improvements in your E-Class will help make the ride into the future smooth and surefooted. But no matter how it motivates the progress of all cars, what will not change is the way the E-Class inspires you, its driver. Not just to dream, but to drive.</p>
                    <p id="black-text-block">An E-Class does not just show you what's new, it introduces you to what's next. As an innovator, it drives the future. As a progressive performance car, it lets you drive it.
